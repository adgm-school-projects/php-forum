# PHP and MySQL Forum
## PHP, MySQL (ClearDB on Heroku)
The purpose of this project was to create a database-driven website.
### This project includes: 
* User account creation and login
* Forum Category, Topic, and Post creation
* Some error handling, although incomplete

This project meets the requirements of using PHP and SQL to create a database-driven application but is functionally incomplete.
Ways in which to improve it:
* Hashed user information storage
* Error handling for posting empty form values
* There is a bug which displays multiples of the same category on the home page when multiple topics are added to that category.
